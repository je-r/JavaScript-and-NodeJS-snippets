how to use:

1)
if needed (some IDEs fetch from package.json automatically):

npm install 

2)
to run: node index.js


3)
to test: 

3.1) open in browser URL: http://localhost:4000/graphql

3.2)  paste testing sequence from test-query.graphql - you can skip
lines that start with "#" as these are merely comments

3.3) press "Play" (>) button and observe result of the web service call

3.4) open in browser URL: http://localhost:4000/web
and observe "hello there!" in HTML directly

(note: Facebook employees internally use *.graphql extension themselves)
